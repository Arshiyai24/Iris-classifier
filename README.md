# Iris Flower Classification - Data Science Internship

## Task Description

In this task, we are required to classify the **Iris flowers** into one of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. These species differ based on the measurements of their physical attributes. The dataset consists of several features like:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

Each flower in the dataset is classified as one of the three species based on the above measurements. The goal of this task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify a given flower into one of these species.

The dataset can be downloaded from a provided link (you can mention the link here if required). Although Scikit-learn offers a built-in dataset for the Iris flower classification, the objective here is to train the model on the downloaded dataset.

## Objective

The goal is to apply machine learning algorithms to this dataset to classify the species of the iris flowers based on their attributes. We will be exploring several classification algorithms to determine which one performs the best for this task.

## Steps Involved:

1. **Dataset Loading**: Import the Iris flower dataset and analyze its structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values (if any), and normalize or scale the data if necessary.
3. **Model Training**: Implement machine learning algorithms such as:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics such as:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
5. **Model Testing**: Test the model on unseen data to check its generalization performance.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of 150 rows, with each row containing 4 features (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) and the corresponding species label.
- **Algorithms**: We will apply multiple machine learning models to classify the iris flowers and compare their performance.
